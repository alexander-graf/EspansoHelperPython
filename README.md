This code example demonstrates a helper application for Espanso, a cross-platform text expander. The application utilizes wxPython to create a user interface with buttons that interact with Espanso's clipboard functionality.

With this application, users can easily copy text from a multi-field to the clipboard, set text from the clipboard to the multi-field, and append single or multiple entries to Espanso's expansion file. This functionality enhances the productivity of Espanso users by providing a convenient way to manage and manipulate text snippets.

By leveraging the wxPython library, this code showcases how to integrate external applications with Espanso, allowing users to streamline their text expansion workflow.
